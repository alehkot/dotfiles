dotfiles
========

[donquixote](http://dqxtech.net)'s .dot files)

Inspired by and forked from [guaka's dotfiles](https://github.com/guaka/dotfiles)

Nothing special, but I recommend everyone to do the same, my shell
life has become much more convenient since I started this.

## How to use

```
cd
git clone git@github.com:donquixote/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

If you want your own repo, just `mv` files you want to add into `~/dotfiles`

Make sure you never put `.bash_history` or `.ssh/*` in a public repo.
