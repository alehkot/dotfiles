dotfiles
========

<a href="http://guaka.org/">guaka</a>'s .dot files

Nothing special, but I recommend everyone to do the same, my shell
life has become much more convenient since I started this.

## How to use

```
cd
git clone git@github.com:guaka/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

If you want your own repo, just `mv` files you want to add into `~/dotfiles`

Make sure you never put `.bash_history` or `.ssh/*` in a public repo.
