dotfiles
========

my .dot files

Nothing special, but I recommend everyone to do the same, my shell
life has become much more convenient since I started this.

## How to use

```
cd
git clone git@github.com:guaka/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

If you want your own repo, just `mv` files you want to add into `~/dotfiles`
